# Data Visualization Project

Welcome to the Data Visualization Project! This repository contains various visualizations created as part of a project to explore and implement different types of data visualization techniques. Each task has its own folder, which includes code, data, and results specific to that type of visualization.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of various data visualization techniques to analyze and interpret complex datasets. Visualizations are categorized based on their functionality, and each task folder contains specific visualizations relevant to that category.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a different visualization technique:

- **Color Maps**: Visualizations focusing on color-based data representation.
- **Contour Maps**: Plots representing data with contour lines to show levels of a variable.
- **Node-Link Diagrams**: Graph-based diagrams to represent relationships between nodes.
- **Parallel Coordinates Plot**: A method for plotting multivariate data.
- **Quiver Plots**: Visualizations using arrows to show vector fields, often used for wind or flow direction data.
- **Tree Maps**: Hierarchical visualizations to represent data with nested rectangles.
